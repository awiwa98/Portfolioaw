            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a curious and creative UX/UI designer currently studying at
              Chas Academy in Stockholm. What drew me to design is the
              combination of psychology, creativity and problem-solving. I enjoy
              creating experiences that make people feel understood and
              supported, whether through intuitive interfaces or thoughtful
              interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm still learning and growing, but Iâ€™m genuinely passionate about
              UX/UI design. I believe that my curiosity and motivation to keep
              developing are key to how I grow as a designer.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not designing, youâ€™ll probably find me outside in nature, at the gym, on a
              yoga mat, or trying to get my cats to pay attention to me ðŸ˜„.

              I believe good design begins with understanding users. Iâ€™m
              interested in learning how people think, what they need, and where
              challenges arise. By conducting interviews, observations, and
              usability testing, I gather insights that help improve design
              solutions.

            <p>
              I focus on designing interfaces that are simple, intuitive, and
              visually effective. My approach combines creativity with usability,
              always keeping the userâ€™s experience at the forefront. I prioritize
              simplicity and consistency in my designs.

              I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. While

              both areas.

            <h4>Empathy and Openness</h4>
            <p>
              I believe in designing with empathy, prioritizing the user's needs,
              and staying open to others' ideas. Sometimes, itâ€™s important to set
              aside personal opinions and "kill your darlings" to discover the
              best solutions.

            <h4>Structure for Efficiency</h4>
            <p>
              I believe a clear structure from the start, both in workflow and
              file organization is key for efficiency. While a bit of chaos can
              spark creativity, maintaining balance and clarity ensures smoother
              progress.

            <h4>Continuous Learning and Growth</h4>

              Design is constantly evolving, and I believe in the importance of
              continuous learning and embracing feedback. Staying updated and
              being open to new ideas is essential for growth as a designer.
